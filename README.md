# Roman-Numeral-Calculator

- - - -

## Introduction ##

This repository is for a program of _Roman Numeral Calculator_ with unit testing of all _mathematical operations_ like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. _Unit testing_ is done by using [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](http://chaijs.com/). 


## Problem ##
The problem was to do mathematical operation with roman numerals (I, V, X, L....). .. For example , it should be able to do the operations  like these.

    XL + X = L

    C - I  = XCIX

    C / X  = X

    X * X  = C

The program should take 3 arguments like the above and give the result( two operands and the operator and perform the operation and print the output ). There should be a unit test for the program (using any unit testing framework).
